Tarien's Day Off Version Notes

-Versions <1.0
Basic game mechanics, including coins and basic guard AI.  Current guard scripts include 
patrols, sight, and tracking.  Also includes doors and "vaultpoints".  Player is only able
to move, sprint, and interact with objects (doors and vaultpoints only).  

-TDOv1.0 - "Guard AI"
Goals:  -Refine Guard AI
		-Guard's stopping at certain patrol points to look around, or looking
		around when the reach the player's last known position.
		-Having guards look where they are going when retracing their steps or
		returing to patrol.
		-Include "reverse patrols", which inverse the order of a patrol pattern
		for patrols box or closed loop patterns. Possibly after a certain number
		of patrols. 
	-Ground Work for Different Guard "Personalities"
		-Design and code different guard AI that perform different, simple tasks.
		Example: Stationary guard vs patrol guard.  Elaboration into different
		enemy types with other abilities can be done in a later version.
